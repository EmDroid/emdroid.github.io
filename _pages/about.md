## Hello and Welcome!

I am a Software Engineer from Czech Republic, currently living in Frankfurt, Germany.

This small Tech Blog is generally about sharing interesting topics and experience I encounter generally on private tasks or projects.

It also serves as my list of various complex tasks to not forget them when needed the next time, and with the hope they can be of help and/or inspiration for the others as well.
