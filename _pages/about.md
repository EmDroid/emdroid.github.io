## Hello and Welcome!

I am a Software Engineer from Czech Republic, currently living in Frankfurt, Germany.

This small Tech Blog is generally about sharing interesting topics and experience
I encounter working on various projects, both privately and professionally.

It also serves as my list of various complex tasks to not forget them when needed
the next time, and with the hope they can be of help and/or inspiration
for the others as well.
